Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. What are programming languages that developers want to work with most?
2. How the language that the programmer works with influences their salary?
3. What influences an individuals Job Satisfaction?

File Descriptions
There is  1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Comments in cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
